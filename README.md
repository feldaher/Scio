# Scio: A Manifesto for Organized Knowledge

> *"Scio"* - Knowledge (Esperanto)

## The Problem We're Solving

Your thoughts deserve better than chaos.

Today's knowledge management tools force an impossible choice: either suffer through ugly, complex systems that require a computer science degree to configure, or surrender your most valuable asset‚Äîyour ideas‚Äîto cloud services that treat your mind as their product.

We believe there's a third way.

## Our Philosophy: Curated Power, Not Cluttered Choice

**Scio is not another plugin ecosystem.** We reject the false promise that infinite customization equals infinite value. Instead of asking you to assemble your own knowledge management system from hundreds of fragmented pieces, Scio provides a carefully crafted, integrated experience that works beautifully from day one.

**Scio is not another cloud service.** Your knowledge belongs to you, stored locally on your devices, in open formats you'll always control. We believe privacy isn't a premium feature‚Äîit's a fundamental right.

**Scio is not another complicated tool.** We're building for the *Focused Professional*‚Äîwriters, researchers, students, and knowledge workers who want to think, not tinker. You shouldn't need a weekend workshop to use your note-taking app.

## What Scio Represents

### üèóÔ∏è **Integrated by Design**
Every feature works together harmoniously. Your notes, tasks, and visual thinking tools share the same elegant design language and data model. No plugins to break, no inconsistent interfaces to navigate.

### üîí **Local-First, Always**
Your data lives on your devices. Export it anytime, in standard formats. Use your own sync solution or ours‚Äîthe choice is yours, and it always will be.

### ‚ú® **Beautiful & Intuitive**
Powerful doesn't have to mean ugly. Complex doesn't have to mean confusing. Scio proves that sophisticated knowledge management can be a joy to use.

### üéØ **Opinionated & Focused**
We make the hard decisions so you don't have to. One excellent task management system. One beautiful whiteboard. One powerful linking system. Perfected, not proliferated.

## Why Open Source? Why AGPL?

Knowledge management is too important to be controlled by any single company. Scio is licensed under AGPL v3 because we believe:

- **Transparency builds trust** - You can see exactly how your data is handled
- **Community drives innovation** - The best ideas come from users who live with the software daily  
- **Longevity requires openness** - Your knowledge deserves tools that will outlast any business model
- **Privacy needs proof** - "Trust us" isn't good enough when it comes to your thoughts

The AGPL ensures that Scio and any derivatives remain free and open, protecting this vision for future generations of knowledge workers.

## For Contributors

We're building something that matters. If you believe that knowledge workers deserve tools that are:
- **Secure** without compromising on features
- **Beautiful** without sacrificing power  
- **Integrated** without becoming bloated
- **Private** without being paranoid

...then we need your help.

Whether you write code, design interfaces, write documentation, or simply use Scio and share feedback‚Äîyou're helping create the future of personal knowledge management.

## For Users

Scio is for you if you:
- Want a powerful knowledge management system, not a hobby project
- Value your privacy and data ownership
- Believe beautiful software is more than vanity‚Äîit's essential for deep work
- Need your tools to work together seamlessly
- Want to think more and configure less

## The Vision

Imagine opening your knowledge management app and feeling joy, not dread. Imagine connecting ideas effortlessly, managing tasks intuitively, and visualizing complex topics beautifully‚Äîall in one cohesive experience that respects your privacy and intelligence.

That's Scio. That's what we're building together.
